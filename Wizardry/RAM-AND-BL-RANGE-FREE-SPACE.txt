Because EA(tm), we can't automatically manage more than one free space range.

This documents what hacks free up what space and what hacks use it.

This doesn't document hacks freeing and reuing the same space for the sake of not making this unneededly complicated

Maybe I could generate usage from a freed space definition file...
